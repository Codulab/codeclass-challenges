#### The Password Strength Challenge

In this challenge you will create a form that will receive a string containing a password that the user is trying to set and you will have to make sure that password is valid and secure. The criterias are:

- At least six characters
- No white spaces
- At least one capital letter
- At least one number
- At least one symbol
- Only the following symbols are allowed: $ # - _ & 

Depending on the user input, you will echo back "Valid" or "Invalid" message.

#### Find the #Hashtags Challenge

In this challenge you will create a form that will receive a string like a user comment in your social network and you will need to retrieve the valid #hashtags that the user inserted during the comment.

The rules to detect a valid #hashtags are:

- Hashtags are alphanumeric strings ([a-zA-Z0-9]) prefixed with the hash symbol "#" (e.g. "#keyword" is a valid hashtag and #2Words!? counts as "2Words" only)
- Hashtags cannot be in the middle of a words or characters (e.g. "some#word" and ".?!#word" are invalid)
- Hash symbols ("#") alone are not valid
- If a word is preceded by more than one hash symbol, only one hashtag counts (e.g. "###keyword" counts only as "keyword")
- Since hashtags are only alphanumeric [a-zA-Z0-9] in case (e.g. "###keyword" counts only as "keyword")

The output should be a string with the hashtags in order separated by commas without spaces

Example: if you enter something like; Woow awesome #pic dude #lmao #omg. The output should be pic,lmao,omg
