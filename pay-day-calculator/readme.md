Create a Paydate Calculator script that when a button is clicked, it must be able to return the next 10 paydates after today.

##### Rules

* The Paydate Calculator must run without generating errors or warnings
* A valid paydate cannot fall on today, a weekend or a holiday
* If a paydate falls on a weekend, increment the date by one day until a valid paydate is reached.
* If a paydate falls on a holiday, decrement the date by one day until a valid paydate is reached.
* Holiday adjustments takes precedence over weekend adjustments
* The initial paydate given to your class should not be adjusted, even if it falls on a weekend or a holiday
